## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Project Sponsor

We would like to extend our thanks to the following sponsor for funding Laravel development. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please contact the [Markfisher Consulting Partners program](https://www.markfisherconsulting.com/).

## Requirements

- **PHP** 7.* or 8.*
- **Composer**
- **MySQL**
- **Laravel** (latest version)
- **Git**

## Installation

*Step 1: Set Up Laravel Project and Database
 *Install Laravel: Make sure you have Composer installed. If not, download it from getcomposer.org.



--composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel Simple-Subscription-Platform

--cd Simple-Subscription-Platform



Install dependencies:


--composer install

*Copy the .env.example to .env:


--cp .env.example .env

*Generate an application key:


--php artisan key:generate

**Database Setup**

Configure your .env file to include the database connection settings for MySQL:


;DB_CONNECTION=mysql

;DB_HOST=000000000

;DB_PORT=0000

;DB_DATABASE=MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

;DB_USERNAME=MMMMMMMMMMM

;DB_PASSWORD=MMMMMMMMMMM

;Create the MySQL database:


**CREATE DATABASE subscription_platform;**
Models and Relationships
Website Model:

Defines hasMany relationship with Post model.
Defines belongsToMany relationship with User model (via subscriptions table).
User Model:

Defines belongsToMany relationship with Website model (via subscriptions table).
Post Model:

Defines belongsTo relationship with Website model.
Migrations
Run the following command to create the tables:


--php artisan migrate


Migration files include:

Websites table with id, name, and timestamps.

Posts table with id, website_id, title, description, and timestamps.

Users table with id, email, and timestamps.

Subscriptions table (pivot table) with website_id, user_id, and timestamps.


API Endpoints

1. Create a Post for a Website

Endpoint: POST /api/websites/{website}/posts
Body: JSON with title and description.
Response: Post created with the specified title and description.

2. Subscribe a User to a Website

Endpoint: POST /api/websites/{website}/subscribe
Body: JSON with email.
Response: User subscribed to the specified website.
Command for Email Notifications
Create a Laravel Artisan command to send emails to subscribers of each website for new posts that have not been sent yet.

The command should:

Check each website.
Fetch all posts that haven't been sent.
Send the post title and description to each subscriber.
Register the command in the Kernel.php file to allow for scheduled running if needed.

Run the command manually with:


--php artisan notify:subscribers

Queue Setup
Configure your .env file to use a queue driver (e.g., database for simplicity).


QUEUE_CONNECTION=database

Run the following to create the necessary queue tables:


--php artisan queue:table

--php artisan migrate

Start the queue worker:


--php artisan queue:work

Seeding Data (Optional)
To seed sample websites and users:

Create seeder classes for Website and User.

Add sample data in the seeder files.

Run the seeders with:


php artisan db:seed
Running the Application
Start the local development server:


--php artisan serve

Access the API at http://localhost:8000.

API Documentation
Document the APIs using OpenAPI or Postman Collection.
Include available API endpoints with request examples and response formats.
Deployment
Push the code to a public GitHub repository.


--git add .

--git commit -m "Initial commit"

--git push origin main

Provide any necessary instructions for setting up the application on a remote server in the README.

Special Instructions

Ensure your local setup has a queue driver enabled to test background processing.

Use php artisan queue:work to continuously process queued jobs.

For local testing, ensure mail configuration in .env is set to log to view emails in the Laravel log file instead of actually sending them.

You can adjust scheduling and queue configurations in config/queue.php and app/Console/Kernel.php for automated background processing.

## This README provides a step-by-step guide to deploy, configure, and run a simple subscription platform API. Follow the instructions above to ensure a smooth setup and successful execution of all application features.
